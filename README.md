# Node.js - Express.js Practice

A personal learning repository to explore and practice **Node.js** and **Express.js** fundamentals and features.

## ðŸ“š Purpose

This repository is not intended to house a single cohesive project. Instead, it's a space where I:

- Learn the core concepts of Node.js and Express.js
- Experiment with new features and modules
- Practice building different types of server-side logic
- Track my progress through meaningful commit history

## âœ… Progress Tracking

Check the commit history to follow my journey and see how my understanding of Express and Node.js develops over time:
[GitHub commit history](https://github.com/LewieJ08/node-express-practice/commits/main)

## ðŸ’¡ Future Plans

- Add database integration (e.g. PostgreSQL)
- Build mini-projects or demos (e.g., REST APIs, CRUD apps)
